Data Immersion Achievement 6 Project Brief: Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Design

Objective

To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

Context

For this Achievement, you'll select your own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, you'll use various advanced analytical approaches to help you test your hypotheses.

The results of your analyses will be presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. Data dashboards are an effective tool for, among other purposes, presenting data in an accessible and tangible way. Your dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and, as such, needs to contain a curation of the key results you discovered throughout this Achievement.
